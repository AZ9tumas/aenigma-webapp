An AI-powered, gamified digital platform designed to enhance learning outcomes for students in rural schools (grades 6-12), focusing on STEM subjects. This project was developed for the **Smart India Hackathon 2025**.

## üöÄ About The Project

The goal of this project is to bridge the educational gap for students in rural areas by making learning interactive, engaging, and accessible. We tackle the challenge of limited internet connectivity by building a Progressive Web App (PWA) that offers offline access to learning content. By incorporating gamification and AI-driven personalization, we aim to increase student engagement by over 15% and provide valuable analytics for teachers.
